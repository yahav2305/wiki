Welcome to my DevOps Engineering Knowledge Base

This website is a comprehensive collection of my knowledge and experience as a DevOps Engineer. Each topic is personally written and based on my hands-on experience with various tools and technologies in the field.

For visitors seeking to understand DevOps concepts and practices, I hope you find the information here valuable and insightful. For recruiters reviewing my resume or LinkedIn profile, I trust this site effectively showcases my expertise and capabilities.

This website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a tool made for converting markdown files to website resources.  
It is deployed on a [netcup](https://www.netcup.eu/) server running [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).  
It has a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deploying changes to the website, implemented using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).  
More details, including architectural decisions, future plans, and pending issues can be found in the readme in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yahav2305/wiki).
