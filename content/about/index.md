# About me

I'm Yahav Deutsch, a DevOps Engineer driven by the thrill of streamlining processes and optimizing workflows. Frustrated by inefficiencies, I find immense satisfaction in automating tasks and building robust infrastructure. This website serves as a dual platform:
- **DevOps Playground:** This website itself is a product of my DevOps expertise. Building it allowed me to implement the tools and techniques I'm passionate about.
- **Skills Showcase:** Explore this site to get a glimpse of my ability to automate tasks, provision infrastructure, and ensure seamless deployments.
# Want to see more?

- **Contact:** Potential employer or just have a question? Get in touch via the contact page above.

# About the website

This website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a tool made for converting markdown files to website resources.  
It is deployed on a [netcup](https://www.netcup.eu/) server running [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).  
It has a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deploying changes to the website, implemented using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).  
More details, including architectural decisions, future plans, and pending issues can be found in the readme in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yahav2305/wiki).
