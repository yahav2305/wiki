This section provides a basic understanding of the Helm release lifecycle, including installation, upgrades, rollbacks, and potential challenges.
# Helm Release Lifecycle
A Helm release represents a deployed instance of a chart. This example demonstrates a Helm release lifecycle for an Nginx deployment:
1. **Initial Installation:**
```sh
helm install nginx-release bitnami/nginx \
--version 7.1.0
```
However, the deployed Nginx version is 1.19.2, indicating an old nginx version which we want to upgrade.
2. **Upgrade:**
```sh
helm upgrade nginx-release bitnami/nginx
```
This command replaces the existing release with a new revision, updating Nginx to the newest stable version.    
# Helm Release History
To review the history of a Helm release and its revisions, use the following command:
```sh
helm history nginx-release
```
This is particularly useful for larger teams to track changes made by other team members.
# Helm Release Rollback
To revert a Helm release to a previous state, use the `helm rollback` command:
```sh
helm rollback nginx-release 1
```
This restores the release to revision 1, but the overall revision count increments to 3, indicating the rollback operation.
# Helm Upgrade Challenges

Helm upgrades can sometimes fail due to various reasons, such as database access issues or configuration errors. Error messages often provide clues to the root cause.
# Helm Rollback Limitations
It's important to note that Helm rollbacks only affect the configuration files and do not restore data. To manage data consistency during upgrades or rollbacks, consider using chart hooks or external backup mechanisms.
